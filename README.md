# Al-Quran
In this repository, I have linked up all Surah with Arabic-Bangla Audio From Youtube. So, you just need to choose and listen. and the ( surah_setup.py ) is free to use, so make your own repo :D
 
## Installation

The [pipeqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) is not working in python-10. So, you have to install all the dependencies manually :(

```bash

pip install pafy

pip install python-vlc

pip install --upgrade youtube-dl

```

# Usage 
## Windows, Linux and Termux :

```
python main_bd.py
```
